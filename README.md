# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a Prework study guide to help with the prework portion of a software development bootcamp. It contains sections on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section contains a list of helpful information and tips for each subject. One can also open up the DevTools console (ctrl+shift+I for windows, command+shift+I for MacOS) to see functional javascript listing the topics learned in the prework phase. The console will also help one decide which of the topics to study first.
